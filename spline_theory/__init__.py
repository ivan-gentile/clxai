"""
Spline Theory Research Extension for CLXAI.

This module contains experiments testing the unified hypothesis connecting:
- Contrastive Learning's geometric properties
- Spline theory (neural network input space partitioning)
- Grokking phenomenon (delayed emergence of generalization)

Core Conjecture:
    Contrastive Learning's training objective naturally induces partition geometry
    similar to the post-grokking state, achieving robust and interpretable behavior
    WITHOUT requiring extended training or reduced regularization.
